# Big O Notation

What is good code? Good code is a code that is __readable__ and __scalable__.

The Big O Notation gives an idea of the scalability of our code. In other words, how efficient our code is.

It is especially important in big tech companies because they manage a lot of data, and as the data increase, the execution speed of the code slows down. So it is very important to optimize the code to make sure it runs as fast as possible.

But how can we mesure code efficiency?

Here is what code efficiency looks like on a Big O chart (Elements is the amount of data past to the function and Operations represent the efficiency of the function):

As we can see, the `O(1)` and `O(log n)` are the most performant scripts and the `O(n!)`and `O(2^n)` are the least perfomant scripts.

When calculating a Big O notation, we always give the worst possible performance for the script and simplify it's notation. For more information please head to the [Big O Simplification] section.

## O(n) - Linear Time

This is probably the most common Big O notation. It simply means that when you have an input of `n` the function will perform `n` operations on it.

As the number of input increases, the number of operations increases in a linear fashion.

If you input an array of size 100, the function will perform 100 operations, if you input an array of 1000000 items, it will perform 1000000 operations!

__Example:__

```
const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0);

function loopArray(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.count(array[i]);
  }
}

loopArray(bigArray);
```

```

## O(1) - Constant Time

Another very common Big O notation. It is the most efficient Big O there is! No matter the size of the input, the function will always perform only one operation.

The input could be an array of 1, 100 or 1000000 elements, the function will always do only 1 operation.

__Example:__

```
const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0);

function firstElement(array) {
  console.count(array[0])
}

firstElement(bigArray);
```

```{block, type="caption"}
Try it out on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@RilDev/Big-O-Notation-O1-Constant-Time){target="_blan"}!
```

__Note:__

If there are multiple operations in the O(1) function, we still write it O(1).

Because no matter how big the input is, the number of operation stills the same, the execution time is still constant.

```
const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0);

function firstTwoElements(array) {
  console.count(array[0]); //O(1)
  console.count(array[1]); //O(1)
  //... //O(1)
  //gives: O(1 + 1 + ...) = O(1)
}

firstTwoElements(bigArray);
```

```{block, type="caption"}

```

## O(n^2) - Quadratic Time

This is a very ineffective Big O. You should avoid it when possible.

Many interview question start with a `quadratic time` function and ask you to make it faster.

One common interview question that you might get is "Log all pairs of an array".

__Example:__

```
const array = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'];

function logAllPairsOfArray(input) {
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) { //O(n)
    for (let j = 1; j < input.length; j++) { //O(n)
      console.log(input[i], input[j]);
    }
  }
}

logAllPairsOfArray(array);

//gives: O(n*n) = O(n^2)
```

```{block, type="caption"}
Try it out on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@RilDev/Big-O-Notation-On2-Quadratic-Time){target="_blank"}!
```

Everytime an element is looped in the first for loop, the entire array is looped in the second for loop. So we multiply `n` by itself: `O(n*n)` = `O(n^2)` _(pronounced: O of n square)_.

## Big O Simplification

Usually, when calculating the Big O of a function. We don't go through the whole function adding every variable assignment, loops and so on, we give the general trend of the function when called with a big input.

__Example:__

```
function complexBigONotation(input) {
  let a = 10; //O(1)
  a = 50 + 3; //O(1)

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) { //O(n)
    anotherFunction(); //O(n)
    let extraBoolean = true; //O(n)
    a++; //O(n)
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) { //O(n)
    a++; //O(n)
  }

  return a; //O(1)
}

//gives: O(n + n + n + n + n + n + 1 + 1 + 1) = O(6n + 3) = O(6n) = O(n)
```

This example function is actually an `O(n)` function.

Here is how we simplify a Big O notation.

### Rule 1: Worst Case

When calculating Big O, we always asume that we are running the function in a worst case scenario. So if we have to loop through an input to look for a value we asume that we always have to loop through all the intems in the input.

__Example:__

```
const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0);
bigArray.push(1);

function loopArray(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.count(array[i]);
    if (array[i] === 1) break;
  }
}

loopArray(bigArray);
```

```{block, type="caption"}
Try it out on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@RilDev/Big-O-Simplification-Worst-Case#index.js){target="_blank"}!
```

Functions with loops looping over the input `for (let i = 0; i < input.length)` will always be at least `O(n)`.

### Rule 2: Remove Constants

When calculating the Big O notation of a function, we remove all the elements that would become unsignificant when feeding huge inputs to our function.

__Example:__

```
const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0);

function complexFunction(array) {
  console.log(array[0]); //O(1)

  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { //O(10)
    console.count(array[i]);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(array.length / 2); i++) { //O(n/2)
    console.count(array[i]);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { //O(n)
    console.count(array[i]);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { //O(n)
    console.count(array[i]);
  }
}

complexFunction(bigArray);


//gives: O(1 + 10 + n/2 + n + n) = O(2n + n/2 + 11) = O(2n + n/2) = O(2n + n) = O(3n) = O(n)
```

```{block, type="caption"}
Try it out on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@RilDev/Big-O-Simplification-Remove-Constants#index.js){target="_blank"}!
```

The function in the previous block gives us `O(2n + n/2 + 11)`.

- If we had an input of `10000` elements, the constant of `11` would be negligeable. So we remove it: `O(2n + n/2)`

- If we had an input of `10000000` elements, dividing by two has a decreasingly important effect. So we remove it: `O(2n + n)` = `O(3n)`

- And finally, because `O(n)` and `O(3n)` are both linear time Big O's (the number of calculations increase linearly as the size of the input increases), we drop the multiplier: `O(n)`

Remember, Big O is about knowing the trend of a function when processing a lot of data. Therefore, if there are fixed operations that are always done by the function not matter the size of the input, we don't include them in our calculation. The same way, if there are multiple calculations that are of the same type (like here, `linear time`) we reduce it the one of the Big O notations on the chart (so `O(3n)` becomes `O(n)`).

### Rule 3: Different Terms For Inputs

When there are multiple inputs, you have to indicate it in the Big O notation.

__Example:__

```
const bigArray1 = Array(100).fill(0);
const bigArray2 = Array(1000).fill(1);

function multipleInputs(array1, array2) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array1.length; i++) { //O(n)
    console.count(array1[i]);
  }
  
  for (let i = 0; i < array2.length; i++) { //O(m)
    console.count(array2[i]);
  }
}

multipleInputs(bigArray1, bigArray2);

//gives: O(n+m)
//NOT: O(2n) = O(n)
```

```{block, type="caption"}
Try it out on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@RilDev/Big-O-Simplification-Different-Terms-For-Inputs#index.js){target="_blank"}!
```

This function is __NOT__ `O(n)` because there are multiple inputs that can be of a totally different sizes.

So the third rule of Big O precises that we have to diffrenciate those inputs in the Big O notation.

Here the notation is: `O(n+m)`

What about nested loops with different arrays? _Glad you asked._ In that case, the notation will be `O(n*m)`.

__Example:__

```
const bigArray1 = Array(10).fill(0);
const bigArray2 = Array(5).fill(1);

function multipleInputs(array1, array2) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array1.length; i++) { //O(n)
    for (let j = 0; j < array2.length; j++) { //(m)
      console.count(bigArray1[i]);
    }
  }
}

multipleInputs(bigArray1, bigArray2);

//gives: O(n*m)
```

```{block, type="caption"}
Try it out on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@RilDev/Big-O-Simplification-Different-Terms-For-Inputs-2){target="_blank"}!
```

Here the notation is `O(n*m)` because at every element in the first loop, all the elements of the second loop will be iterated over.

A good rule of thumb to differenciate `O(n+m)` and `O(n*m)` is: Every step that happens in the same indentation (one after another), you add `+`. And everything that happens with an indentation that is nested, you multiply `*`.

### Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants

Since Big O notation is concerned with big inputs, we drop everything that would be insignificant when passing a lot of data to the function.

__Example:__

```
const bigArray = Array(200).fill(0);

function complexBigO(array) {
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) { //O(100)
    console.count(array[i]);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { //O(n)
    console.count(array[i]);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { //O(n)
    for (let j = 0; j < array.length; j++) { //O(n)
      console.count(array[i] + array[j]);
    }
  }
}

complexBigO(bigArray);

//gives: O(100 + n + n * n) = O(100 + n + n^2) = O(n + n^2) = O(n^2)
```

```{block, type="caption"}
Try it out on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@RilDev/Big-O-Simplification-Drop-Non-Dominants#index.js){target="_blank"}!
```

The function above has a Big O complexity of `O(100 + n + n^2)`.

Even with a relatively small input, like here with 200 elements, we quickly realize that the `O(n^2)` trumps all other complexities present:

- the `O(100)` will perform 100 operations
- the `O(n)` will perform 200 operations
- the `O(n^2)` will perform 40 000 operations!

We can then simply remove the `O(100)` and `O(n)` since there impact on performance will be negligeable compared to the `O(n^2)` time complexity.
