# Interviewgator

_Review and practice common data structures to prepare for your... interviewgation!_

Stack: [ BookDown ](https://bookdown.org/)

Website URL: [https://rildev.github.io/interviewgator/](https://rildev.github.io/interviewgator/)

Acknowledgement: This book is based of Andrei Neagoie's [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/)

## Useful Information from BookDown 
This is a minimal bookdown example. Although you see a few files here, only `index.Rmd` is requived. All other files are optional, but `bookdown-minimal.Rproj` can make it much easier to build the book.

The key is the `site` setting in `index.Rmd`. If you want to build the book in RStudio, just click the `Build Book` button in the `Build` pane, otherwise call the function in R:

```r
bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'all')
```

or simply in the CLI: 

```
Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'all')"
```
