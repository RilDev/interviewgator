Some are very common, others less so. They all have specific strengths and weaknesses when it comes to access data, insert data, delete data, search the data structure...

We are going to explore the ones you are going to meet the most often during your developer journey.

Remember, at the end of the day, programs are simply data structures and algorithms.

`Data Structures + Algorithms = Program`

And great programmers know how to pick the right data structure with the right algorithms to write good programs. Programs that are readable and scalable.
