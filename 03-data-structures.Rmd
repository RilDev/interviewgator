# Data Structures

In computer programming, data structures are the different ways available to the programmer to store data.

Some are very common, others less so. They all have specific strengths and weaknesses when it comes to access data, insert data, delete data, search the data structure...

We are going to explore the ones you are going to meet the most often during your developer journey.

Remember, at the end of the day, programs are simply data structures and algorithms.

`Data Structures + Algorithms = Program`

And great programmers know how to pick the right data structure with the right algorithms to write good programs. Programs that are readable and scalable.

No matter if you are a web developer or a game developer or anything in between, once you understand data-structure and algorithms, you will be able to use them to solve all kind of technical problems. That's why companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon ask questions on data-structures and algorithms, because although it may be important to know the latest and greatest Javascript syntax or library, those things change. If you know the fondamentals though, you will be able to make the right decision in any situation. This is why this knowledge is so valuable.

## What Is A Data-Structure?

A data-structure is a collection of values. The values can have relations among them and functions applied to them. Each one is diffrent in what it can do and what it is useful for. __Each data-structure is good / specialized for it's own thing.__

Data-structure are like containers such as a back-pack, a fridge or a folder, each has its specialty: the back-pack for books, the fridge for food and the folder for documents.

There are two parts to a data-structure:

1. How to build one

2. How to use it

The goal of this chapter is to understand data-structure so that you can pick the right one for the job.

### How Computers Store Data

In order to understand the value of data-structures, we have to go deep down into the way computers work at a fundamental level. In order for a computer to run code, you have to keep track of things like variables (numbers, strings, arrays). The variables are store in the Random Access Memory (RAM). That's how programs run. On top of that, we have storage to store our video files, music files, documents... that storage in contrast with the RAM is persistant. When we shut down our computer, those files stay on the drive. So why not only use persistant storage to run programs? The problem with persistant storage is that it is slow.

A computer is run by the Central Processing Unit (CPU), it is the part doing all the calcualtions that we need. The CPU needs access to the RAM and the storage. But it can access the information in the RAM a lot faster.

When we use a software, the CPU holds all the variables it needs to run the software in the RAM. And when it saves something in the program, it stores permanently some information in the storage. Like it, next time we turn on the computer, our files will still be here.

A RAM is like a massive shelf, that holds data. Each of these shelves is composed of 8 bits. A bit is either on of off, 1 or 0. A series of 8 bits is called a byte. So each shelves in RAM is composed of 1 byte. The RAM has a memory controller that allows the CPU to access any byte very fast. Keep in mind that the memory controller will access bytes that are closed together faster. In addition, the CPU has a tiny cache to speed up even more memory access.

### Why Is This Important For Data Structure?

Data structures are ways for us to store information. For example, with a `var a = 1`, the integer `1` is stored in the RAM as a 32 or 64 (for more recent systems) bit informantion.

A data structure is a way to manage data in the RAM. Some are organized close to each other, some are organized far from each other. And each one has different pros and cons when accessing and writing to the RAM.

We are now going to learn more about data structures with this low level knowledge of how computers work.

Each language may have different data types (numbers, strings, booleans...) and data structures (arrays, objects...) to organize these data types.

Does it mean that we have to stick to the data structures available in a perticular language? Not really, we can create new data structures from existing ones!

## Array Data Structure

Arrays organize items sequentially, that means one after another in memory. They are probably the simplest and most widely used data structure. Arrays have the least amount of rules. And because they are stores sequentially in memory, they also have the smallest footprint of all data structures. If all you need is to store data and to iterate over it, arrays are the best choice. Especially if you know the indexes of the items stored.

### Array's Big O

lookup | push | insert | delete
--- | --- | --- | ---
O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | O(n)

__Example:__

```
const strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'];
// the strings array occupies 4 bytes for each letter => 4 bytes * 4 = 16 bytes in memory

// lookup: O(1)
// to see what is the value at the demanded index
console.log('lookup strings[2]: ' + strings[2]);
// lookups in arrays are constant time, O(1), because the computer already knows where the 3rd item is going to be since the array is squentially stored in memory.

// push: O(1)
// add an item at the end of the array
strings.push('e');
console.log(`strings.push('e'): ${strings}`);
// pushes are constant time, O(1), because the new item is simply added at the end of the array in memory, without looping over anything.

// pop: O(1)
// remove an item from the end of the array
strings.pop();
console.log(`strings.pop(): ${strings}`);
// popes are also constant time, O(1), because we simply remove the last item, without looping through anything.

// unshift: O(n)
// add an item at the begining of the array
strings.unshift('z');
console.log(`strings.unshift('z'): ${strings}`);
// unshiftes are linear time, O(n), because when we add an item at the begining, we then have to loop through all the items to reasign the indexes to all the values that have been displaced.

// splice: O(n)
// in this example, we will use splice to insert an item at the desired index
strings.splice(2, 0, 'n');
console.log(`strings.splice(2, 0, 'n'): ${strings}`);
// splices are linear time, O(n), because we have to reassign the indexes that appear after the spliced part of the array by looping through them. We write it O(n) because we always plan for the worst case senario when using Big O notation.
```

```{block, type="caption"}

```

So arrays are really good for lookups and pushes. But not so good for inserting and deleting in an other place than at the end of the array.

### Static VS Dynamic Arrays

There are two types of arrays: static arrays and dynamic arrays.

What is the difference between the two?

__Static Arrays:__ are fixed in size. You need to know the number of elements your array will hold ahead of time. Because arrays are allocated in adjacent blocks of memory when they are created there is no guaranty that after allocating a certain number of items in memory that you can keep on adding things on. Especially in order. So we solve this problem with static arrays by telling ahead of time how many shelves of memory we want to allocate to it. 

__Dynamic Arrays:__ are expandable in size. If needed, the array can be automatically expanded by copying it to a new location in memory with double it original size. For example, if we wanted to add an eighth item to a seven items array, that array would be copied to another location in memory with 14 shelves of memory and the eighth item would be added to it.

When dynamic arrays add a new item that exceeds their current size, they loop through all the items in the array to copy them to a new place in memory with *usually* two times more space in memory than the original array.

Because of this, the Big O of dynamic arrays is as follow:

lookup | append\* | insert | delete
--- | --- | --- | ---
O(1) | O(1) | O(n) | O(n)

```{block, type="caption"}
*can be O(n)
```

*Note: in Big O notation tables, append is the same a push*

Low level languages like C++ let us use static arrays that we have to manually manage, while higher level languages like Java, Python or JavaScript use dynamic arrays. It is a trade of: speed for convinence. Low level languages allow us to tweak things to make them much faster, but it is harder to manage.

Most of the time during interviews, you will be working with dynamic arrays. But it is important to understand things at a fundamental level. For instance, now you know that to `push` an item in an array is `O(1)`, but that once in a while, it can be an `O(n)` operation.

### How To Build An Array

Following is a basic array implementation:

```
class CustomArray {
  // constructor: length and data
  constructor() {
    this.length = 0;
    this.data = {};
  }

  // get: return value at specific index
  get(index) {
    return this.data[index];
  }

  // push: append item at the end of the array
  push(item) {
    // add item at the end of the array
    this.data[this.length] = item;
    // increase length property
    this.length++;
    // return updated length property
    return this.length;
  }

  // pop: remove array's last element
  pop() {
    // copy last item
    const lastItem = this.data[this.length - 1];
    // delete last item
    delete this.data[this.length - 1];
    // decrease length
    this.length--;
    // return last item's copy
    return lastItem;
  }

  // delete: delete an item at specified index
  delete(index) {
    // copy index to delete
    const deletedItem = this.data[index]
    // shift elements from index to delete
    this.shiftItemsIndex(index);
    // remove last element
    delete this.data[this.length - 1];
    // return deleted item
    return deletedItem;
  }

  // shift items' indexes to the left to remove item at specified index
  shiftItemsIndex(index) {
    // loop from index to the end of the array,
    // attribute to each index the value of the next item
    for (let i = index; i < this.length; i++) {
      this.data[i] = this.data[i + 1];
    }
  }

}

// create new array
const newArray = new CustomArray();
// log the array
console.log('created array:');
console.log(newArray);
console.log('---')

// push items to the array
newArray.push(1);
newArray.push(2);
newArray.push(3);
newArray.push(4);
newArray.push(5);
newArray.push(6);
newArray.push(7);
// log push result
console.log('push to array:');
console.log(newArray);
console.log('---')

// pop items from array
newArray.pop();
newArray.pop();
newArray.pop();
// log pop result
console.log('pop from array:');
console.log(newArray);
console.log('---')

// delete items from array
newArray.delete(2);
// log delete result
console.log('delete from array:');
console.log(newArray);
console.log('---')

// get item in array
console.log('get item in array:');
console.log(newArray.get(1));
```

_Note: Array in JavaScript are objects._

_Note: String questions should be treated as array questions. You can use a method like `split` to convert it to an array, loop through it, and then retrun it as a string._

### How To Use An Array

The following are common interview questions.

#### Reverse A String

```
// Reverse a string
// input: string
// output: string reversed
// checks: no input, too many inputs, input not a string, input less than 2 characters, large input
// errors: no input, too many inputs, not a string
// efficiency: O(n)
// notes: none

function reverseString(string) {
  // errors
  // no input or too many input
  if (arguments.length !== 1) {
    throw Error('Function takes exactly 1 input of type string.')
  }

  // input not a string
  if (typeof string !== 'string') {
    throw Error('Input must be of type string.')
  }

  // checks
  // string length < 2, no need to loop
  if (string.length < 2) {
    return string;
  }

  // reverse string
  // create reversed string variable
  let reversedString = '';
  // loop through the string backward and push current value to reversed string
  for (let i = string.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    reversedString+= string[i];
  }

  // return reversed string
  return reversedString;
}

// test the function
// basic
console.log(reverseString('Hello World!'));
// empty string
console.log(reverseString(''));
// small string
console.log(reverseString('a'));
console.log(reverseString('ab'));
console.log(reverseString('abc'));
// large string
console.log(reverseString('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce finibus, massa in fermentum posuere, erat ligula molestie mi, sed auctor enim lacus varius eros. Vestibulum consequat iaculis cursus. Donec quam massa, consectetur sed quam sed, consectetur feugiat enim. Cras nibh massa, cursus et tellus ac, euismod sagittis lacus. In malesuada, nunc id finibus pretium, ligula velit hendrerit metus, vitae tincidunt erat diam pellentesque ante. Suspendisse dictum purus nunc, ac vehicula lectus luctus vitae. Proin euismod urna a eleifend gravida. Praesent ornare elementum diam quis accumsan. Vivamus volutpat metus a odio efficitur tempus. Phasellus blandit dapibus neque nec viverra. Pellentesque ut lacus quis orci viverra volutpat. Maecenas eleifend iaculis ligula a imperdiet. Nam a ornare nisi. Pellentesque cursus, massa at facilisis elementum, neque lacus euismod massa, quis ultrices elit massa in tellus.'))

//errors, uncomment 1 by 1 to see the error messages
// no input
// console.log(reverseString());
// input not of type string
// console.log(reverseString(123));
// more than 1 input
// console.log(reverseString('test1', 'test2'));
// input is a boolean
// console.log(reverseString(true));
// input is an object
// console.log(reverseString({}));
// input is an array
// console.log(reverseString([]));
```

Another solution, specific to JavaScript ES6 could have been:

```
// Reverse a string
// input: string
// output: string reversed
// checks: no input, too many inputs, input not a string, input less than 2 characters, large input
// errors: no input, too many inputs, not a string
// efficiency: O(n)
// notes: none

const reverseString = string => [...string].reverse().join('');

// test the function
// basic
console.log(reverseString('Hello World!'));
// empty string
console.log(reverseString(''));
// small string
console.log(reverseString('a'));
console.log(reverseString('ab'));
console.log(reverseString('abc'));
// large string
console.log(reverseString('Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Fusce finibus, massa in fermentum posuere, erat ligula molestie mi, sed auctor enim lacus varius eros. Vestibulum consequat iaculis cursus. Donec quam massa, consectetur sed quam sed, consectetur feugiat enim. Cras nibh massa, cursus et tellus ac, euismod sagittis lacus. In malesuada, nunc id finibus pretium, ligula velit hendrerit metus, vitae tincidunt erat diam pellentesque ante. Suspendisse dictum purus nunc, ac vehicula lectus luctus vitae. Proin euismod urna a eleifend gravida. Praesent ornare elementum diam quis accumsan. Vivamus volutpat metus a odio efficitur tempus. Phasellus blandit dapibus neque nec viverra. Pellentesque ut lacus quis orci viverra volutpat. Maecenas eleifend iaculis ligula a imperdiet. Nam a ornare nisi. Pellentesque cursus, massa at facilisis elementum, neque lacus euismod massa, quis ultrices elit massa in tellus.'))

//errors, uncomment 1 by 1 to see the error messages
// no input
// console.log(reverseString());
// input not of type string
// console.log(reverseString(123));
// more than 1 input
// console.log(reverseString('test1', 'test2'));
// input is a boolean
// console.log(reverseString(true));
// input is an object
// console.log(reverseString({}));
// input is an array
// console.log(reverseString([]));
```

```{block, type="caption"}

_Note: The behavior of this function is slightly different from the previous one. See if it fits your needs!_

### Merge Sorted Arrays

```
// merge sorted arrays
// input: 2 arrays of integers
// output: 1 merged & sorted array of integers
// example: [1,2,3] & [1,2,3] => [1,1,2,2,3,3]
// check: no input, too many inputs, only one array, not arrays, empty arrays, array not exclusively composed of integers, small arrays, big arrays
// error: no input, too many inputs, only one array, not arrays, array not exclusively composed of integers
// efficiency: time O(n) & space O(n)
// notes: are given arrays sorted? are there only integers in the array, or can I get float, strings...? are the integers only positive numbers?

function mergeSortedArrays(array1, array2) {
  // errors
  // no input, only one input, too many inputs
  if (arguments.length !== 2) {
    throw Error('Function must be invoqued with exaclty 2 arguments.')
  }
  // inputs not arrays
  for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    if (Array.isArray(arguments[i]) === false) {
      throw Error('Function only takes Arrays.')
    }
  }
  
  // inputs contain something else than integers
  for (argument of arguments) {
    if (argument.some(value => typeof value !== 'number')) {
      throw Error('Arrays must contain only numbers.')
    }
  }

  // checks
  // empty array: return the other array as is. if both empty, return the first one.
  if (array1.length === 0) {
    return array2;
  }
  if (array2.length === 0) {
    return array1;
  }

  // concatenate the sorted arrays
  // init variables
  const mergedArray = []; // final result
  let array1Element = array1[0];
  let array2Element = array2[0];
  let array1Counter = 1;
  let array2Counter = 1;
  
  // starting from element 0 of arrays, compare each elements.
  while (array1Element || array2Element) {
    // if element form array1 is smaller than element from array2, push element array1 to mergedArray, else push element array2 to mergedArray
    // check if array2Element exist (not undefined), if it does check the values if not, directly push array1Element.
    // if array1Element does not exist, array1Element < array2Element will return false. So it will push array2Element to the mergedArray.
    // At this point you could separate this check logic to it's own function for readability. If you don't have the time to do so, simply tell the interviewer. He will count it as if you coded it.
    if (!array2Element || array1Element < array2Element) {
      mergedArray.push(array1Element);
      array1Element = array1[array1Counter]; // assign array1Element to next value in array1
      array1Counter++; // update counter
    } else {
      mergedArray.push(array2Element);
      array2Element = array2[array2Counter]; // assign array2Element to next value in array2
      array2Counter++; // update counter
    }
  }
  
  // return concatenated sorted array
  return mergedArray;
}

// tests
// basic
console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1,2,3], [1,2,3]));
console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1,2,3], [1,2]));
console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1], [1,2,3]));
// small arrays
console.log(mergeSortedArrays([], []));
console.log(mergeSortedArrays([], [1,2,3]));
console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1,2,3], []));
// big arrays
const bigArray = () => Array(10000).fill(0)
console.log(mergeSortedArrays(bigArray(), bigArray()));

// errors: uncomment lines 1 by 1 to test errors
// no input
// console.log(mergeSortedArrays());
// only one input
// console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1,2,3]));
// more than 2 inputs
// console.log(mergeSortedArrays([1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3]));
// inputs not arrays
// console.log(mergeSortedArrays('1,2,3', 5));
// inputs contain something else that integers
// console.log(mergeSortedArrays(['a','b','c'], [1,2,3]));

Remember that if you don't have the time to code something, you can simply tell the interviewer what you would do if you had the time. He will count it as if you actually coded it!
