# Playground

_Coming Soon..._

This playground will be composed of 2 screens: one for inputs and one for the outputs.

The input screen will have 2 tabs: one for defining functions and the other to specify inputs and expected results for every function. Every function may have multiple rows of inputs/expected results.

The output screen will show all the results. For each function, all the inputs, outputs and expected results. As well as a counter to display: passing function count / total function call count.

Here is a quick wireframe of what I'm talking about: [https://wireframe.cc/4LRTGu](https://wireframe.cc/4LRTGu){target="_blank"}


Here is a little prototype made with [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php){target="_blank"}: [Download Interviewgator.p8](./assets/interviewgator.p8)

__Note:__ This is only a POC. At this time, you will need to have the [Pico-8 devtool](https://www.lexaloffle.com/games.php?page=updates){target="_blank"} to run this game. It's 15$. Sorry about that. I'll be working on a fully featured JS playground (complitly free) when I have the time.
