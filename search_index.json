Good code is a code that is readable and scalable. Big O Notation gives an idea of the scalability of our code. In other words, how efficient our code is. It is especially important in big tech companies because they manage a lot of data, and as the data increase, the execution speed of the code slows down. So it is very important to optimize the code to make sure it runs as fast as possible. But how can we mesure code efficiency? Here is what code efficiency looks like on a Big O chart (Elements is the amount of data past to the function and Operations represent the efficiency of the function): Big O Complexity Chart from bigocheatsheet.com As we can see, the O(1) and O(log n) are the most performant scripts and the O(n!)and O(2^n) are the least perfomant scripts. When calculating a Big O notation, we always give the worst possible performance for the script and simplify the notation by removing constants, different terms for input and droping the non dominant. For more information please head to the Big O Simplification section. 1.1 O(n) - Linear Time This is probably the most common Big O notation. It simply means that when you have an input of n the script will perform n operations on it. As the number of input increases, the number of operations increases in a linear fashion. If you input an array of size 100, the function will perform 100 operations, if you input an array of 1000000 items, it will perform 1000000 operations! Example: const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0); function loopArray(array) { for (let i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) { console.count(array[i]); } } loopArray(bigArray); Try it out on repl.it! 1.2 O(1) - Constant Time Another very common Big O notation. It is the most efficient Big O there is! No matter the size of the input, the function will always perform only one operation. The input could be an array of 1, 100 or 1000000 elements, the function will always do only 1 operation. Example: const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0); function firstElement(array) { console.count(array[0]) } firstElement(bigArray); Try it out on repl.it! Note: If there are multiple operations in the O(1) function, we still write it O(1). Because no matter how big the input is, the number of operation stills the same, the execution time is still constant. const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0); function firstTwoElements(array) { console.count(array[0]); //O(1) console.count(array[1]); //O(1) //... //O(1) //gives: O(1 + 1 + ...) = O(1) } firstTwoElements(bigArray); Try it out on repl.it! 1.3 Big O Simplification Usually, when calculating the Big O of a function. We don’t go through the whole function adding every variable assignment, loops and so on, we give the general trend of the function when called with a big input. Example: function complexBigONotation(input) { let a = 10; //O(1) a = 50 + 3; //O(1) for (let i = 0; i &lt; input.length; i++) { //O(n) anotherFunction(); //O(n) let extraBoolean = true; //O(n) a++; //O(n) } for (let i = 0; i &lt; input.length; i++) { //O(n) a++; //O(n) } return a; //O(1) } //gives: O(n + n + n + n + n + n + 1 + 1 + 1) = O(6n + 3) = O(6n) = O(n) This example function is actually an O(n) function. Here is how we simplify a Big O notation. 1.3.1 Rule 1: Worst Case When calculating Big O, we always asume that we are running the function in a worst case scenario. So if we have to loop through an input to look for a value we asume that we always have to loop through all the intems in the input. Example: const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0); bigArray.push(1); function loopArray(array) { for (let i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) { console.count(array[i]); if (array[i] === 1) break; } } loopArray(bigArray); Try it out on repl.it! Functions with loops looping over the input for (let i = 0; i &lt; input.length) will always be at least O(n). 1.3.2 Rule 2: Remove Constants When calculating the Big O notation of a function, we remove all the elements that would become unsignificant when feeding huge inputs to our function. Example: const bigArray = new Array(100).fill(0); function complexFunction(array) { console.log(array[0]); //O(1) for (let i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { //O(10) console.count(array[i]); } for (let i = 0; i &lt; Math.floor(array.length / 2); i++) { //O(n/2) console.count(array[i]); } for (let i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) { //O(n) console.count(array[i]); } for (let i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) { //O(n) console.count(array[i]); } } complexFunction(bigArray); //gives: O(1 + 10 + n/2 + n + n) = O(2n + n/2 + 11) = O(2n + n/2) = O(2n + n) = O(3n) = O(n) Try it out on repl.it! The function in the previous block gives us O(2n + n/2 + 11). If we had an input of 10000 elements, the constant of 11 would be negligeable. So we remove it: O(2n + n/2) If we had an input of 10000000 elements, dividing by two has a decreasingly important effect. So we remove it: O(2n + n) = O(3n) And finally, because O(n) and O(3n) are both linear time Big O’s (the number of calculations increase linearly as the size of the input increases), we drop the multiplier: O(n) Remember, Big O is about knowing the trend of a function when processing a lot of data. Therefore, if there are fixed operations that are always done by the function not matter the size of the input, we don’t include them in our calculation. The same way, if there are multiple calculations that are of the same type (like here, linear time) we reduce it the one of the Big O notations on the chart (so O(3n) becomes O(n)). 1.3.3 Rule 3: Different Terms For Inputs When there are multiple inputs, you have to indicate it in the Big O notation. Example: const bigArray1 = Array(100).fill(0); const bigArray2 = Array(1000).fill(1); function multipleInputs(array1, array2) { for (let i = 0; i &lt; array1.length; i++) { console.count(array1[i]); } for (let i = 0; i &lt; array2.length; i++) { console.count(array2[i]); } } multipleInputs(bigArray1, bigArray2); //gives: O(n+m) //NOT: O(2n) = O(n) Try it out on repl.it! This function is NOT O(n) because there are multiple inputs that can be of a totally different sizes. So the third rule of Big O precises that we have to diffrenciate those inputs in the Big O notation. Here the notation is: O(n+m) 1.3.4 Rule 4: Drop Non Dominants "],
