Big O Notation gives an idea of the scalability of our code. In other words, how efficient our code is. It is especially important in big tech companies because they manage a lot of data, and as the data increase, the execution speed of the code slows down. So it is very important to optimize the code to make sure it runs as fast as possible. But how can we mesure code efficiency? Here is what code efficiency looks like on a Big O chart (Elements is the amount of data past to the function and Operations represent the efficiency of the function): Big O Complexity Chart from bigocheatsheet.com As we can see, the O(1) and O(log n) are the most performant scripts and the O(n!)and O(2^n) are the least perfomant scripts. When calculating a Big O notation, we always give the worst possible performance for the script and simplify the notation by removing static elements. 1.1 O(n) Linear Time This is probably the most common Big O notation. It simply means that when you have an input of n the script will perform n operations on it. Example: const bigArray = new Array(10000).fill(0); function loopArray(array) { for (let i = 0; i &lt; array.length; i++) { console.count(array[i]); } } loopArray(bigArray); Try it out on repl.it!
